In this repo I am experimenting, I will be looking at a number of things like currency, top compainies and other economic data from South Africa

Looking at the Banks excluding Capitec Bank which has the highest share price and market cap in South Africa

On the plot below I am looking at Nedbank, Standard bank, Absa and First Rand for the past 5 years
